# DistillationDesignProject

Some scripts used for a design project for CHE 200, Equilibirum Stage Operations. A ternary system of Acetone, n-Butanol and Ethanol were to be seperated to a desired purity. The distillation design was sized up using McCabe-Thiel method for Acetone Ethanol and the Fenkse-Underwood-Gilliland method for the ternary system for a flash drum and a sieve-tray distillation column.

Additionally, some other ASPEN Plus files are in the repo from other projects, including LNG process design and amine extraction.
